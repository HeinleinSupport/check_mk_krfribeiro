# Check_MK 
My own plugins, checks, checkman's and bug correction of Check_MK.

Everything i've been doing with Check_MK:
  - Checks
  - Plugins (.bat ; .ps1 ; .sh ) 
  - PNP Templates
  - Wato plugins
  - (..)

And so on!

Feel free to use, and of course, get it better!

Attention: 
  I'm not a developer (at all!) - i just had the need to get things done, and this is how i did it - perhaps not the best way, but it's the way i could! If you do it better, please share as well :) Perhpaps i might learn something :)

Cheers! :)
